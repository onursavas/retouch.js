# Changelog

All notable changes to `@retouchjs/core` and `@retouchjs/ml` are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); both packages use
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and share a version number.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-19

The first release since 0.0.2 turns a crop/brightness prototype into a full image *and video*
editor with an on-device ML companion package. `@retouchjs/ml` is published for the first time.

### Breaking changes since 0.0.2

- **Video is accepted by default.** `acceptedTypes` now covers images only; MP4/WebM/MOV arrive
  through the new `acceptedVideoTypes` (default `["video/mp4", "video/webm", "video/quicktime"]`).
  Pass `acceptedVideoTypes: []` to keep the 0.0.2 behavior.
- **Done bakes edits into the image** (`commitMode: "bake"`, the new default): after Done, an
  entry's `file` and pixels are the edited version and the pristine original moves to
  `entry.original`. Set `commitMode: "keep-edits"` for the old parametric-until-export behavior.
- **Entries are a union.** `getEditingEntry()` returns `MediaEntry | null`, the `images:add`
  payload is `{ entries: MediaEntry[] }`, and `editor:done` carries `ImageEdits | VideoEdits`.
  Narrow with the exported `isImageEntry` / `isVideoEntry` (or `entry.kind`).
- `getImages()` is deprecated (it silently omits videos) — use `getMedia()`.
- `ImageEdits` grew from three fields to the full edit model (orientation, flips, keystone, lens,
  seam width, liquify, curves, HSL, masks, stylize, filter + strength, …). Code that constructed
  `ImageEdits` literals by hand will need every field; `Adjustments` now has 14 keys.
- Runtime dependencies: `fabric` (static import), `mediabunny` and `gifenc` (loaded lazily, only
  when a video or GIF is exported). 0.0.2 had none.

### Added — editor

- Feature-group tabs on a left rail with a contextual control strip under the canvas; tabs are
  registry-driven (`tools` option) and pluggable via `Retouch.registerTool` (plugin API v1).
- **Crop** (commit-style apply, aspect presets, thirds grid) · **Transform** (rotate 90°/flip,
  straighten with auto-crop, keystone, lens distortion + devignette, content-aware width via seam
  carving in a worker) · **Liquify** (brush push warp) · **Adjust** (14 controls incl. exposure,
  temperature/tint, vibrance, clarity, dehaze, white-balance eyedropper) · **Curves** (master + RGB,
  live histogram) · **Color mix** (8-band HSL) · **Masks** (linear/radial selective adjustments) ·
  **Stylize** (tilt-shift, duotone, posterize, pixelate, halftone) · **Filters** (11 presets with
  intensity and live thumbnails).
- Undo/redo history with a timeline menu; keyboard operability (Esc, ⌘/Ctrl+Enter, ⌘/Ctrl+Z/⇧Z/Y,
  ⌘/Ctrl+K, 1–9, Enter, Space) with a focus trap and dialog ARIA.
- Side-by-side compare view (images), hold-to-compare (video), Reset, and `restoreOriginal(id)` /
  `replaceImageSource(id, file)` with `image:commit` / `image:restore` events.
- Toast notifications for rejected files and export errors; `file:rejected` reasons
  `type | size | duration | count | load-error`; `maxFileSize` and `maxVideoDuration` options.

### Added — video

- Video ingestion with poster cards and duration badges; playback transport with crop, adjust and
  filters live on the frame; **Trim** tool with filmstrip, in/out handles, loop-in-range and
  keyboard nudging; playback speed 0.25–4×.
- Re-encoded MP4/WebM export through WebCodecs (mediabunny) with audio, one-tap mute, per-file
  `export:*` progress events, an export overlay and `cancelExport()`; packet copy when nothing
  changed; a MediaRecorder fallback for browsers without WebCodecs.
- Frame capture into a new image entry, GIF-of-range export (forward/reverse/boomerang), deflicker,
  and poster pick.

### Added — AI

- ✦ Ask AI panel (⌘K): natural-language edits mapped onto the manual tools' edit operations as
  one undoable step, with a downscaled frame for content-aware commands. Token-gated via
  `ai: { apiKey | baseUrl | complete | allowUserKey }`; `ai:start` / `ai:applied` / `ai:error`
  events.

### Added — gallery & API

- Six gallery view modes (2/3/4 columns, width-fit, height-fit, list), an add-more drop target,
  and a **Done** button whenever `onDone` is configured.
- Export options (`export: { format, quality, maxDimension }`), `exportGif()`, `downloadImage()`,
  `cancelExport()`; `refreshRangeFill` for plugin sliders.

### Added — design system & theming

- "Warm atelier / neutral darkroom" visual system: semantic CSS tokens per world (light shell,
  true-neutral editor), a unified 24-grid/1.5-stroke icon set, property-scoped motion with entrance
  keyframes and `prefers-reduced-motion`, focus rings, filled slider tracks, and a documented
  theming contract (override tokens on `.rt-root` or the overlay roots).

### Added — `@retouchjs/ml` 0.1.0 (first release)

Seven editor tabs, each also available as a headless function, running through ONNX Runtime Web
(WebGPU → WASM fallback, inference in a worker, weights cached via the Cache API):

- **Cutout** — MODNet background removal (any BiRefNet export via `modelUrl`)
- **Upscale** — tiled Real-ESRGAN 4× with seam-free overlap
- **Erase** — LaMa heal brush, composited back in place
- **Detect** — UltraFace faces + YOLOX-nano objects (80 COCO classes) → masks, privacy pixelate,
  crop-to-boxes
- **Select** — SlimSAM click-to-segment with add/subtract refinement → cut out or erase object
- **Depth** — Depth Anything V2 Small bokeh with click-to-focus and aperture
- **Denoise** — SCUNet real-noise removal (split graph + weights sidecar via `externalDataUrl`)

Default model URLs are pinned to specific upstream revisions. All default weights are MIT,
Apache-2.0 or BSD-3 licensed — see `docs/ADVANCED-FEATURES.md` for the audit.

### Fixed

- Sample-accurate trim: packet copy is reserved for untouched full-range exports.
- History no longer records no-op checkpoints ("phantom Edit steps").
- The compare button no longer inherits the host page's colors; the compare view is discoverable.
- ML results open in the editor with honest status text; heavy models run in a worker so the UI
  never freezes.

### Tooling

- CI on every push: typecheck → lint → tests → builds → a Node smoke test that imports both built
  packages and inspects their tarballs → demo build; GitHub Pages deploys only from a green `main`.
- `publish.sh` releases both packages in dependency order with `pnpm publish`.

## [0.0.2] — 2026-02-19

Initial public release: drop zone → gallery → editor with crop, rotation and brightness/contrast/
saturation adjustments; `onDone` export to Blobs.
