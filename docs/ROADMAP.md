# Rétouch Roadmap

Feature catalog and build order. Priorities: **P1** = next, **P2** = soon, **P3** = later.
Status: ✅ shipped · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ planned.

Release history lives in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md); the research and
license audit behind the ML and advanced-feature rows is in
[ADVANCED-FEATURES.md](ADVANCED-FEATURES.md).
